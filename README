# NeuroTetris

NeuroTetris is a futuristic Tetris variant that adapts to your play style and psychological state in real time. It features quantum blocks, AI-driven adaptive difficulty, simulated biometrics, in-game IQ estimation, psychological profiling, and a hidden narrative about AI civilization communication.

## Features

- **AI-driven adaptive difficulty** that responds to stress and focus levels
- **Quantum blocks** with superposition states for unique gameplay
- **Biometric simulation** (stress/focus tracking)
- **In-game IQ estimation** based on your performance and decision patterns
- **Hidden narrative** revealed through play
- **Energy-based special abilities** (gravity flip, time slow, block fragment)
- **Psychological profiling** to analyze your decision patterns
- **Future-ready** for VR, real biometric devices, and cloud collaboration
